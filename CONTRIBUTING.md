# Contributing to Silius

Thanks for your help in improving the project! We are so happy to have you!

Silius is an open-source ERC-4337 bundler implementation in Rust. It doesn't matter how experienced you are with Rust or account abstraction (ERC-4337); there is definitely something to help us.

**No contribution is too small!**

This guide will help you get started. If you are familiar with open-source contributions, feel free to skip this document.

# Why contribute

- help build the infrastructure for account abstraction (ERC-4337)
- learn how it's like to contribute to the Ethereum core protocol
- work on the Ethereum protocol in Rust
- have fun
- any other personal reason

# How to contribute

This project operates like any other open-source project on GitHub.

## Finding something to work on

1. The best way to start is to find an issue to work on; if you need more information, leave a comment or join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/+sKeRcN4j3MM3NmNk). If you think of something for which the issue doesn't exist, create a new one.
2. Work on the issue in your personal fork.
3. Once you finish your work, open a pull request and reference the issue you worked on. Make sure your PR successfully passes the GitHub CI.
4. All pull requests will be reviewed, and sometimes you will have to make some changes based on the received comments.
5. When your PR is approved, the code will be merged, and you can tell everyone you contributed to open-source code!

## Setting up the project/environment

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your computer.
2. Create a new branch. The name of your branch should start with:
    - feat: if you're adding a new feature (e.g., feat/bundling_strategy)
    - chore: if you're making some updates, no production code changes (e.g., chore/rename)
    - fix: if you're fixing some bugs (e.g., fix/debug_rpc)
3. Commit the changes and add a commit message describing the changes.
4. Push the changes to your fork.
5. Create a pull request to this repo on the GitHub website.
