_Account Abstraction has for a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community._

<i>__- Vitalik Buterin__</i>

## What are the design goals?

**1. Modular**

Architecture of the Silius is composed of multiple components - bundling component, user operation mempool, and JSON-RPC server. This allows you to customize your deployment and run only what you need.

**2. Reusable**

Each major feature is implemented as a separate Rust crate, which makes it possible to reuse code in your project as a building block.

**3. Efficient**

Efficiency is in our mind when we develop and merge new code. ðŸ¦€
